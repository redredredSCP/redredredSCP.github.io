				Hello sir, could you teach me how to be a real punk?
			</div>
			<div>
				I'm good at reading guides and I can pay a lump sum
			</div>
			<div>
				I like Tori Amos and don't really fit in
			</div>
			<div>
				With the girls at my school 'cause they like gentlemen
			</div>
			<div>
				My favorite year for music was 1979
			</div>
			<div>
				My favorite label's SST or maybe EMI
			</div>
			<div>
				And Fugazi's okay, but he's a little too loud
			</div>
			<div>
				Wish I could give him something so he could chill out
			</div>
			<div>
				And I like all the fashion: all the pants and armbands
			</div>
			<div>
				I like how all of the bands can somehow understand
			</div>
			<div>
				I like watching the people who cry at the swastikas
			</div>
			<div>
				I like how easy it is to see when they're not one of us
			</div>
			<div>
				And when I see them at shows, I go and spit in their eyes
			</div>
			<div>
				Cause he took a job that really oughta be mine
			</div>
			<div>
				I can work all day and I can work all night
			</div>
			<div>
				But I still got no money or any songs to write
			</div>
			<div>
				And I try really hard but I still always lose
			</div>
			<div>
				Wish it was Germany here; wish I could get some black boots
			</div>
			<div>
				I'd be willing to starve or sleep for days on the ground
			</div>
			<div>
				If for once I could stomp those other losers down
			</div>
			<div>
				So I know this is weird for just an on-the-street meeting
			</div>
			<div>
				But Mr. Rollins, could--Wait, why are you leaving?

			<div>
				Unrealistic things, things
			</div>
			<div>
				That only women worry in
			</div>
			<div>
				The throes of their dreams
			</div>
			<div>
				But still I worry.
			</div>
			<div>
				I worry about you the
			</div>
			<div>
				Way you see me.
			</div>
			<div>
				Though I realize, clawing at
			</div>
			<div>
				That cliff above me
			</div>
			<div>
				That what you were seeing
			</div>
			<div>
				Was nothing.
			</div>
			<div>
				Fuck me, I'm such a hyperreal thing
			</div>
			<div>
				I exist only in your thoughts
			</div>
			<div>
				When they catch your mind
			</div>
			<div>
				Like lightning--
			</div>
			<div>
				When they stare through your sheets
			</div>
			<div>
				Keeping you up nightly
			</div>
			<div>
				When they run you out of town,
			</div>
			<div>
				A mob of nothing chasing nothing.
			</div>
			<div>
				But I wouldn't exist without them
			</div>
			<div>
				And so each night I worry thusly.
			</div>
			<div>
				/
			</div>
			<div>
				There is no purpose to worry
			</div>
			<div>
				Broken machines break down daily
			</div>
			<div>
				Their arms and legs smashing oceans
			</div>
			<div>
				Beneath their immense, bloated weight
			</div>
			<div>
				And you never say sorry
			</div>
			<div>
				Though you claw to escape daily
			</div>
			<div>
				The pillow softness of blinding clouds
			</div>
			<div>
				Your head so full of soft sounds
			</div>
			<div>
				You don't mind the endless wait
			</div>
			<div>
				And when you descend it's only
			</div>
			<div>
				To call open the chorus empty
			</div>
			<div>
				And spill out pathetic nothings
			</div>
			<div>
				To a crowd of nobody
			</div>
			<div>
				And you smile and think of it
			</div>
			<div>
				As something worth celebrating
			</div>
			<div>
				But cool doesn't stop for
			</div>
			<div>
				Anything or Anyone

				It marches forward for

				Why you can't just fucking lie

			<div>
				About whatever you're thinking

				You've got a teenage skyscraper soul

				Terrified of jagged curves or folds

				It's a real bummer man
			</div>
			<div>
				Realizing how deep your head was
			</div>
			<div>
				In the sand
			</div>
			<div>
				And you see that the sky and the ground
			</div>
			<div>
				Share the same sound
			</div>
			<div>
				And that nothing you ever said
			</div>
			<div>
				Was ever really profound
			</div>
			<div>
				Or even remotely interesting
			</div>
			<div>
				And that your parents were probably correct
			</div>
			<div>
				In almost everything they said
			</div>
			<div>
				And though their real truths were never found
			</div>
			<div>
				At least they tried, there and then
			</div>
			<div>
				To give you a peaceful night in your bed
			</div>
			<div>
				And small kisses on your head
			</div>
			<div>
				When you bawl your eyes out once again
			</div>
			<div>
				With the pain of other people and the world at large
			</div>
			<div>
				It could be worse
			</div>
			<div>
				It could be so much worse, my friend
			</div>
			<div>
				It could have been so much worse than them

			<div>
				Trying sometimes isn't enough
			</div>
			<div>
				When you've got a job greater than the world
			</div>
			<div>
				And twice as tough as the sharpest hills
			</div>
			<div>
				At the desolation row
			</div>
			<div>
				And shame will get you only half as far
			</div>
			<div>
				As giving up to guilt
			</div>
			<div>
				Though I know you're too weak, you could never do
			</div>
			<div>
				What I wanted to do and sometimes think I will
			</div>
			<div>
				Because romance has destroyed any indication
			</div>
			<div>
				That love takes any kind of skill
			</div>
			<div>
				A thought that will never die will never grow larger
			</div>
			<div>
				And a stone never shatters and will never be killed
			</div>
			<div>
				Unless I stop being so fucking scared and tell you

				You're the biggest failure I know

				Decompresses

				Or I could be ur weatherman

				Watching my tone when the snow begins to fall

				Because you're still a little religious

				Upwards like some alien's looking at you

				Like an old bear trap

				To me

				With rusty staples.

				There's no pleasure to it;

				There's no joy nor ecstacy

				Only the obliterating excitement that comes

				From doing something against my own survival

				Of staring in fucking awe that I let another creature

				One of these days these women will realize

				As they wake up in my bed in my clothes

			<div>
				Looking down across the floor
			</div>
			<div>
				One day they're gonna realize

			<div>
				Listening to me snore like an old dog
			</div>
			<div>
				A vinyl spinning out nothing in the corner
			</div>
			<div>
				A dusty television

			<div>
				Chips in the paint at the bottom of the door

			<div>
				Scraps of meat in the garbage

			<div>
				Horsehair from the ceiling

				They're gonna look at those things

				I can't see it now

			<div>
				It's a thin hole like a straw

			<div>
				But I remember when I was younger

			<div>
				And I didn't know how much there was to know
			</div>
			<div>
				When I was playing with my friends
			</div>
			<div>
				And I was drinking sweet stuff
			</div>
			<div>
				The first day I stopped feeling like a kid
			</div>
			<div>
				I completed my first mile
			</div>
			<div>
				And I was so confused and so touched
			</div>
			<div>
				Because I felt for the first time
			</div>
			<div>
				That I was fat
			</div>
			<div>
				I looked in the bathroom mirror and saw how
			</div>
			<div>
				Small and round my fingers were
			</div>
			<div>
				I learned that there were some things
			</div>
			<div>
				That were too large for me to hold
			</div>
			<div>
				I looked at myself and learned
			</div>
			<div>
				Why they spoke to me with their cheeks puffed
			</div>
			<div>
				I learned what white people were

			<div>
				And that I was never a part of them

				Oh, terrified to find a single weakness

			<div>
				Leaning back on one old sturdy leg

			<div>
				Never learning how to lean left or right
			</div>
			<div>
				And so confused and wondering where they went
			</div>
			<div>
				Smart enough to see where time will go
			</div>
			<div>
				So you burned down everything you could see
			</div>
			<div>
				That reminded you of your old bitter friend
			</div>
			<div>
				You never realized they were never your enemy

			<div>
				And you sit alone on a couch from '09
			</div>
			<div>
				And you don't know why people wanna be uncomfortable
			</div>
			<div>
				And you say to yourself you're just not
			</div>
			<div>
				That kind of person
			</div>
			<div>
				So you fall asleep without even giving it a try
			</div>
			<div>
				And you wonder how people can be so strange
			</div>
			<div>
				And so unafraid to fall

			<div>
				You save up your money and wait for times to change

				I really enjoy talking to you
