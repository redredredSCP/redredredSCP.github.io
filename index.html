				Hello sir, could you teach me how to be a real punk?
			</div>
			<div>
				I'm good at reading guides and I can pay a lump sum
			</div>
			<div>
				I like Tori Amos and don't really fit in
			</div>
			<div>
				With the girls at my school 'cause they like gentlemen
			</div>
			<div>
				My favorite year for music was 1979
			</div>
			<div>
				My favorite label's SST or maybe EMI
			</div>
			<div>
				And Fugazi's okay, but he's a little too loud
			</div>
			<div>
				Wish I could give him something so he could chill out
			</div>
			<div>
				And I like all the fashion: all the pants and armbands
			</div>
			<div>
				I like how all of the bands can somehow understand
			</div>
			<div>
				I like watching the people who cry at the swastikas
			</div>
			<div>
				I like how easy it is to see when they're not one of us
			</div>
			<div>
				And when I see them at shows, I go and spit in their eyes
			</div>
			<div>
				Cause he took a job that really oughta be mine
			</div>
			<div>
				I can work all day and I can work all night
			</div>
			<div>
				But I still got no money or any songs to write
			</div>
			<div>
				And I try really hard but I still always lose
			</div>
			<div>
				Wish it was Germany here; wish I could get some black boots
			</div>
			<div>
				I'd be willing to starve or sleep for days on the ground
			</div>
			<div>
				If for once I could stomp those other losers down
			</div>
			<div>
				So I know this is weird for just an on-the-street meeting
			</div>
			<div>
				But Mr. Rollins, could--Wait, why are you leaving?

			<h2>
				"untitled 05-02-2022 1&2"

			<div>
				I worry.
			</div>
			<div>
				I worry about many things:
			</div>
			<div>
				Unrealistic things, things
			</div>
			<div>
				That only women worry in
			</div>
			<div>
				The throes of their dreams
			</div>
			<div>
				But still I worry.
			</div>
			<div>
				I worry about you the
			</div>
			<div>
				Way you see me.
			</div>
			<div>
				Though I realize, clawing at
			</div>
			<div>
				That cliff above me
			</div>
			<div>
				That what you were seeing
			</div>
			<div>
				Was nothing.
			</div>
			<div>
				Fuck me, I'm such a hyperreal thing
			</div>
			<div>
				I exist only in your thoughts
			</div>
			<div>
				When they catch your mind
			</div>
			<div>
				Like lightning--
			</div>
			<div>
				When they stare through your sheets
			</div>
			<div>
				Keeping you up nightly
			</div>
			<div>
				When they run you out of town,
			</div>
			<div>
				A mob of nothing chasing nothing.
			</div>
			<div>
				But I wouldn't exist without them
			</div>
			<div>
				And so each night I worry thusly.
			</div>
			<div>
				/
			</div>
			<div>
				There is no purpose to worry
			</div>
			<div>
				Broken machines break down daily
			</div>
			<div>
				Their arms and legs smashing oceans
			</div>
			<div>
				Beneath their immense, bloated weight
			</div>
			<div>
				And you never say sorry
			</div>
			<div>
				Though you claw to escape daily
			</div>
			<div>
				The pillow softness of blinding clouds
			</div>
			<div>
				Your head so full of soft sounds
			</div>
			<div>
				You don't mind the endless wait
			</div>
			<div>
				And when you descend it's only
			</div>
			<div>
				To call open the chorus empty
			</div>
			<div>
				And spill out pathetic nothings
			</div>
			<div>
				To a crowd of nobody
			</div>
			<div>
				And you smile and think of it
			</div>
			<div>
				As something worth celebrating
			</div>
			<div>
				But cool doesn't stop for
			</div>
			<div>
				Anything or Anyone
			</div>
			<div>
				It marches forward for
			</div>
			<div>
				Another machine to burn down.
