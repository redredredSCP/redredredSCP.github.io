				Oh--She looks at me with terror
			</div>
			<div>
				Counting seven in the night
			</div>
			<div>
				You can turn all of the lights out
			</div>
			<div>
				If you're scared of the respite
			</div>
			<div>
				He never minded anyway--
			</div>
			<div>
				He never minded cause it's easier
			</div>
			<div>
				To just forget her name.
			</div>
			<div>
				Oh--You're too good to follow orders
			</div>
			<div>
				But that's where rests all your talent
			</div>
			<div>
				She's the love of all her teachers
			</div>
			<div>
				But her husband, she never found it
			</div>
			<div>
				And when I counted nine
			</div>
			<div>
				She still burned only to die
			</div>
			<div>
				'Cause she knew how bad it would go
			</div>
			<div>
				For the rest of her corrupt nothing life.

				And you heard Jesus speak to you
			</div>
			<div>
				From deep inside your head
			</div>
			<div>
				He said you could never follow through
			</div>
			<div>
				On pulling out that thread
			</div>
			<div>
				And you're in love with Bowie
			</div>
			<div>
				Cause he was nothing then
			</div>
			<div>
				And you love how he was thinner
			</div>
			<div>
				Than other peoples' friends
			</div>
			<div>
				And you were sad for your parents
			</div>
			<div>
				Because they had to handle you
			</div>
			<div>
				And you heard the way they wondered
			</div>
			<div>
				Ways to dismantle you
			</div>
			<div>
				And you never found nobody
			</div>
			<div>
				As graceful or forlorn
			</div>
			<div>
				Who prayed to God their mother died
			</div>
			<div>
				The day before they were born
			</div>
			<div>
				And I will never understand
			</div>
			<div>
				The method you tried to find
			</div>
			<div>
				But I know it's thankless
			</div>
			<div>
				To be the one that's left behind
			</div>
			<div>
				And I know it's worthless
			</div>
			<div>
				To ask why you wanted to die
			</div>
			<div>
				'Cause if I knew you better I'd know
			</div>
			<div>
				You already made up your mind.

			<h2>

			<div>
				Put your arm around me, little nothing
			</div>
			<div>
				Breathe out through your back, little nothing
			</div>
			<div>
				And when your bones softly creak
			</div>
			<div>
				blurred eyes hidden beneath my cheek
			</div>
			<div>
				You reach your arm around me
			</div>
			<div>
				And hold your own hand
			</div>
			<div>
				It's softer than your face
			</div>
			<div>
				Softer than the softest grace
			</div>
			<div>
				I hear his voice from the carpet
			</div>
			<div>
				The voice you wake up to
			</div>
			<div>
				Smothered by the air
			</div>
			<div>
				Smothered by me in your underwear
			</div>
			<div>
				Sleep beside me now, little nothing
			</div>
			<div>
				Keep inside that loving gaze
			</div>
			<div>
				Little nothing, don't mind me now
			</div>
			<div>
				I made a terrible mistake.
